# sign-up

Problem\

Create a sign up form with a background image, a logo on the left, a form on the right and submit button below. The form field must have the full name, the e-mail, the phone number and the password/ password confirmation. Above the form section a text section should be implemented.

Plan\

The user should input the data in the form fields. The fields should do first data check and give an error message if entry is invalid. At the same time the respective data field borders should be colored red. When user is in the data field the respective data field border should be blue. The normal state is a light gray. If not focused the data fields should show the correct format of the required input.

Pseudocode\

Default settings are loaded with placeholders showing the correct input format\
When user click a field the placeholder disappears and the border becomes blue of the respective field\
If the entry is not correct\
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Display an error message and color the border red\
Else color the border green\
